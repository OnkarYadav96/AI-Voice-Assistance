Voice-Controlled Music and Web Assistant
This Python project is an interactive voice command assistant that recognizes your speech, responds using text-to-speech, and can perform tasks such as opening popular websites and playing predefined songs from a music library.

Features
Speech Recognition: Listens for your voice commands and converts them into actionable tasks using the speechrecognition library.

Text-to-Speech: Delivers spoken feedback with the help of pyttsx3.

Voice Commands for Web: Opens websites like Google, YouTube, and LinkedIn based on your commands.

Music Library Integration: Plays songs by matching voice commands to song titles in a predefined music library (musicLibrary.py).

Usage
Start the Assistant

Run main.py in your terminal or preferred IDE.

The assistant greets you and waits for voice commands.

Examples of Commands

Say "open Google" to launch Google in your browser.

Say "play song [song name]" to play a specific song from your music library.

Extensible Library

Add or modify song entries in musicLibrary.py to change the available music options.

Requirements
Python 3.x

speechrecognition (for recognizing speech)

pyttsx3 (for voice output)

webbrowser (for opening URLs)

Microphone input (for capturing voice commands)

Setup
Install dependencies:

text
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3
(Optional) Install PyAudio for microphone access:

text
pip install pyaudio
Make sure your microphone is configured and enabled.

Customization
Edit musicLibrary.py to add YouTube links or other supported sources for new songs.

Adapt the command-checking logic in main.py for more actions or custom responses.
